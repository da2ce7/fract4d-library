## Fract4D Library

#### This repository contains fractal related assets such as: colour maps, formulas, etc.

*This repository has two sub-categories of items:*  

**Colour Mappings**  
The fractal formulas may be presented using different visual methods: Colour Maps associate number-ranges with ranges of visual colours.
* For more details please see the [/color\_maps/](/color\_maps/README.md) sub-directory.

**Fractals Formulas**  
Fractal are mathematical formulas that produces visual output using appropriate interpenetration.
* For more details please see the [/fractals/](/fractals/README.md) sub-directory.


*Goal*      
The intent of this repository is to provide an easy way for authors to collaborate and share assets, (formulas, maps, etc.) related to fractal generation.

*Licence*  
All formulas in the database are MIT-licensed *except* those in the orgform directory.  
See [/fractals/README.md](fractals/README.md#orgform) for more detail.
