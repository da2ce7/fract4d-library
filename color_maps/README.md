### Colour Mappings

##### A colour mapping is used to display the data produced by the mathematical fractal functions visually.
    
As the output of the fractal function must be interpreted into visual data: various mappings of data-values and visual-values can be used.  
* *Different mappings have useful, artistic, and distinct characteristics.*  


*This folder contains one sub-folder:*
